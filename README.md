## 🏗️ System Architecture

The project follows a standard decoupled React architecture where the frontend communicates securely with a Supabase backend.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Frontend ["React Client (Vite)"]
        UI["UI Components / Pages"]
        Context["Context Providers<br>Auth, Cart, Wishlist"]
        Router["React Router DOM"]
        
        UI --> Context
        UI --> Router
    end

    subgraph Backend ["Supabase"]
        Auth["Supabase Auth"]
        DB[("PostgreSQL DB")]
        Storage["Blob Storage"]
    end

    Context -- "API Calls" --> Auth
    UI -- "CRUD Operations" --> DB
    UI -- "Fetch Assets" --> Storage
```

### 1. User Authentication Workflow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI as React UI
    participant AuthCtx as AuthContext
    participant Supabase as Supabase Auth

    User->>UI: Enter Credentials (Login/Signup)
    UI->>AuthCtx: Trigger login(email, pass)
    AuthCtx->>Supabase: Authenticate Request
    alt Success
        Supabase-->>AuthCtx: Return Session & User Data
        AuthCtx-->>UI: Update isAuthenticated = true
        UI-->>User: Redirect to Profile / Checkout
    else Failure
        Supabase-->>AuthCtx: Return Error
        AuthCtx-->>UI: Throw Error Exception
        UI-->>User: Show Error Toast
    end
```

### 2. E-commerce Checkout Workflow
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
